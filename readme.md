# Text Adventure Engine

This is my attempt at building my own text adventure engine from scratch. Not really an engine as it consists of mostly hardcoded values but the end goal will be to develop a way for users to create there own adventures.

As of now, I'm building a story based around an old work place as I build out the necessary code.

Pull in dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Run the code

```bash
npm run start
```

Run Typescript watcher while developing. You'll need to restart the project for code changes to take affect

```bash
npm run watch
```
